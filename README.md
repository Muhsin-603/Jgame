# ÔøΩÔ∏è Lullaby Down Below
A 2D top-down psychological stealth-horror game.

This project, originally conceived as Buglife, has evolved! We're now building **Lullaby Down Below**, an atmospheric horror game using the same custom Java Swing engine. Players take the role of a lost baby crawling through the dark lower floors of an abandoned nursery, guided by a glowing snail and hunted by spiders, all while following the faint sound of a lullaby.

    * Strategic resource distribution
    * Risk/reward exploration incentives

* **Survival Systems:**
    * Real-time health management
    * Visual HUD with status effects
    * Strategic food placement system
    * Constant tension through health decay
    * Multiple challenge levels

* **Robust Physics Engine:**
    * Circular collision detection for entity interactions
    * Tile-based environmental collision system
    * Precise hitbox calculations for all game entities
    * Smart bounded camera following
    * Optimized collision checks with spatial partitioning

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Open in your favorite Java IDE** (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.).
3.  **Configure the Classpath:** Ensure both the `src` and `res` folders are marked as "Source Roots". This is the most critical step and the hiding place of many ghosts.
4.  **Locate and run `Game.java`** (`src/com/buglife/main/Game.java`).
5.  Survive.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Systems
* **Game Loop**: Stable 60 FPS with delta time calculations
* **Rendering Pipeline**: Efficient Java Swing-based graphics system
* **Input Handling**: Responsive keyboard controls with state management

### Entity Framework
* **Player System**: Health management, movement states, sprite animations
* **Spider AI**: Waypoint following, rotation calculations, collision avoidance
* **Food System**: Strategic placement with validity checking

### World Management
* **Tile System**: 64x64 pixel tiles with type-based properties
* **Camera**: Player-following viewport with culling optimization
* **Collision**: Multi-layer detection (entity-to-entity, entity-to-wall)

## üìú Project History: The Metamorphosis

This project began as Buglife, a survival game about a bug. Through extensive development and bug-hunting (see previous README revisions for the epic saga), a robust 2D top-down engine was forged. The project has now pivoted to Lullaby Down Below, repurposing the existing engine to tell a darker, more atmospheric story.

### Setup Nightmares
Battled invisible files, incorrect package declarations, misplaced .java files, and IDEs that refused to acknowledge the existence of entire folders (src, res). The .classpath file became both our most hated enemy and our most trusted weapon.

### The Sprite Scavenger Hunt
Fought countless NullPointerExceptions and crashes caused by incorrect file paths, case-sensitive filename typos, corrupted PNG metadata (readMetadata, decodeImage), and the vengeful .classpath file rendering entire asset folders invisible.

### The Collision Conundrum
Overcame the paradox of rotated visual sprites versus static rectangular hitboxes (solved with circular collision), only to face invisible hitboxes due to size mismatches and characters trapped in "pixel-perfect prisons" by off-by-one boundary checks.

### The AI Uprising
Our spiders developed existential crises (checking their own state for WEBBED), suffered amnesia (forgetting crucial methods like getRadius), got stuck in anxiety loops (pacing back and forth), spawned inside walls, divided by zero resulting in dimensional warping (NaN/Infinity coordinates), and achieved perfect stealth (random invisibility bugs).

* **The Ghost in the Machine (The `.classpath` Haunting):** The most stubborn ghost of all. It hid in the IDE's configuration, making our `res` folder invisible to the game engine. It took multiple rituals and a manual file creation to finally evict this poltergeist. **Status: EVICTED.**

* **The Disco Spider & The Moonwalk:** Our enemies were born with a rebellious spirit, spinning in place and moonwalking in the wrong direction. We battled their inverted compasses and taught them the laws of trigonometry. **Status: Choreographed into submission.**

## üéÆ Game Design Document (Lullaby Down Below Summary)

#### Game Overview
* **Genre:** 2D Top-Down Stealth Horror / Survival Adventure
* **Core Concept:** A baby falls down a chimney into abandoned lower floors and must crawl back up, guided by a glowing snail and hunted by spiders, following a lullaby.
* **Key Mechanics:** 
    * Stealth (hiding, noise)
    * Survival (hunger/cry)
    * AI Detection (sound, light, movement)
    * Companion NPC (snail)
