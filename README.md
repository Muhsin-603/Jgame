# üêû Buglife

Welcome to **Buglife**, a top-down stealth and survival game with a dark, humorous twist.  
You are a bug. Your world is a kitchen. Your goal is to survive the horrors of a human household.  
Good luck. You'll need it.

This project is a journey into **game development from scratch** using a custom **Java Swing engine**.  
It's a tale of pixel prisons, ghost plates, and the triumphant birth of a digital universe ‚Äî one late-night coding session at a time.
